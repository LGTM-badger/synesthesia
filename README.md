# Synesthesia Composer

This is the composer part of the synesthesia project. A 5 minute lightning talk
of the project can be found here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egsswPi8yio>

It is very much a work in progress!

## Special Thanks

The style of this app has been heavily inspired by the
[Vertex Theme for GTK](https://github.com/horst3180/vertex-theme)
